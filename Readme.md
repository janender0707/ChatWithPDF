# ChatWithPDF

ChatWithPDF is an AI-powered web application that allows users to upload a PDF and interact with its content through a chat interface. This application uses LangChain for natural language processing, Pinecone for vector storage, Cloudinary for PDF file management, and MongoDB to store metadata. The project is built with a React frontend and a Node.js backend.
